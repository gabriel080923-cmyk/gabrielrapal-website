                    <p>Hello! I’m Gabriel Rapal, an 18-year-old passionate about boxing, born on September 8, 2007. I am currently an amateur boxer with a record of 10 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw, competing in the 50–53 kg weight category. I have been training in boxing for three years, starting around April 2023, and this year my goal is to turn professional and take my boxing career to the next level.</p>

                <h3>Year 2023</h3>
                <p>"Starting from scratch this year, I stepped into the ring and earned 3 wins, 1 loss, and 1 draw as a beginner. Every match taught me the basics of boxing, from footwork to defense, and helped me discover my passion for the sport. It was a year of learning, pushing my limits, and laying the foundation for my boxing journey."</p>

                <h3>Year 2024</h3>
                <p>"I fought 4 matches and finished the year with a 3-1 record, learning and growing with every fight. In 2025, I continued training and competing, ending the year with a 6-2-1 record. Each match, win, loss, or draw has shaped me, and I’m just getting started on this path to becoming stronger and better in the ring."</p>

                <h3>Year 2025</h3>
                <p>"2025 was one of my toughest years, testing me both mentally and physically due to events outside the ring. Despite the challenges, I fought hard and ended the year with a 3-2 record, bringing my overall career record to 10-4-1. Every fight, win or loss, has shaped me, and I continue to grow stronger with each match."</p>
